# C-GenericADT
Generic ADT that will help us with the worldAtlas (the previous project).

## What does it contain?
* Generic LinkedList. Supports the following functions: create, destroy, append node, delete node, display list, search for node.

* Generic KeyValuePair. Supports the following functions: create, destroy, displayValue, displayKey, getValue, getKey, isEqualKey.

* Generic HashTable that contains keyValuePair. Collisions treated with chaining. Supports the following functions: create, destroy, add pair, lookup for pair, remove pair, display elements.

## How does it work?
run the following command:
```./Globe <HashNumber>< numberOfCountries><configuration>```
while <HashNumber> is the required size of the hashtable, and the other parameters are the same as the previous project.
